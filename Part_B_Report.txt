1. Ben Yu and Kevin Zhu
2. Original HMM parameters:
    a. Total count of correctly tagged words in the test data: 29531
    b. Total count of words in the test data: 73523
    c. Percentage correct (calculated from the previous two values): 40.166%
3. HMM parameters with Laplace smoothing:
    a. Total count of correctly tagged words in the test data: 70868
    b. Total count of words in the test data: 73523
    c. Percentage correct (calculated from the previous two values): 96.389%
4. Something you learned doing this assignment:
   LaPlace smoothing for extremely large training sets will make a HUGE impact on the
   performance when evaluating a hidden Markov Model, likely because it heavily prevents
   overfitting
5. Biggest challenge you faced doing this assignment:
   Both implementing the algorithms, as well as finding a way to keep the file size for the
   JSON files relatively small (at least, small enough for GradeScope) were both rather challenging.
