This folder contains the starter code for option 2 of the final project in
CSE 473, Autumn 2020, at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science
and Engineering.  The code was written by Steve Tanimoto, to facilitate
students' explorations of the use of Hidden Markov Models in
Part-Of-Speech tagging in Natural Language Processing.

The data here comes to CSE 473 by way of TA Amir Mola, who took 
CSE 447 taught by Prof. Yejin Choi.  The tagging of this data was
the topic of a research paper by Gimpel et al at Carnegie-Mellon Univ.
One of the authors was Dr. Noah Smith, now an NLP faculty member in
the Allen School.

For details on how the code is intended to be used and/or completed,
see the full specification on the CSE 473 project web page.

Version 1.0 of the starter code was released November 25, 2020.
The code here is V 1.0.
